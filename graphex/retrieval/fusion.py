"""Fuse the retrieval signals into one relevance score per node.

The default pipeline:

1. BM25 picks lexical *seeds* (which nodes the query is literally about).
2. Personalized PageRank spreads that signal across the weighted graph.
3. A light importance/god-node prior nudges genuinely central entities up.

When a dense backend is available, its ranking is folded in with Reciprocal
Rank Fusion (RRF) — rank-based, so it needs no score calibration between the
lexical and dense scales.
