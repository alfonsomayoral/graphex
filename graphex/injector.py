"""Extract real source bodies from disk and attach them to graph nodes.

graphify records *where* an entity lives (``source_file`` + ``source_location``)
but not its full text. For a small, already-selected subgraph it is worth reading
the actual code back so the formatter can show it — an LLM reasoning over the
subgraph benefits far more from a function's body than from its one-line summary.

Two extraction strategies are used, picked by file extension:

- **Python** (``.py``): indentation-based. Starting from the header line, we keep
  every following line whose indentation is *strictly greater* than the header's,
  stopping at the first non-blank line indented at or below the header. This
  captures a ``def``/``class`` block without needing to parse it.
- **Brace languages** (``.ts``/``.tsx``/``.js``/``.jsx``/``.go``): brace-balanced.
  Starting from the header, we accumulate lines until the running ``{``/``}`` depth
  returns to zero *after* the first ``{`` has been seen (checked at end of line).

Both strategies cap the result at ``max_lines`` lines.
